Assignment 2 AI Documentation
I used Claude AI to help me clean up my directory and ensure that the files and folders were set up correctly for a successful run. 
For the code I had the artifical intelligence review my inital code and identify my syntax errors. After fixing those I recieved compilation errors and used Claude to 
discover my ETLPipeline.java file was 0 bytes (empty) and kept recieving a ClassNotFoundException" error so we troubleshooted the problem by checking directory structure.
